summary: Alleged insider traders got caught thinking inside the box.

One of the best pieces of advice inexperienced writers can get is
"find your own voice."
Another thing people say, though, is
["good artists copy; great artists steal."](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20141112-great-artists-steal)
In the latter spirit, I'm going to give my thoughts about an insider trading
enforcement action that just hit the news.
[Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff?itm_source=record&itm_campaign=Matt_Levine%E2%80%99s_Money_Stuff&itm_content=title)
is on vacation this week, so I can safely avoid an unflattering direct comparison
for a few days.

### The Case

The story here is largely straightforward for an insider trading case.
Some guys allegedly got information about a merger before it was public and
loaded up on call options on the company being acquired. From the [article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/minor-league-baseball-players-accused-223553242.html) (Bloomberg, via Yahoo! Finance):

>Four current and former minor league baseball players illegally traded on Jack in the Box Inc.’s $575 million purchase of Del Taco Restaurants Inc., according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
> ...
>According to the SEC, Qsar was told about the upcoming purchase by a former teammate from Pepperdine University’s baseball team who was working on the due diligence of the acquisition for Jack in the Box. The SEC said Qsar learned about the deal when he was out drinking with his former teammate in San Diego in October 2021.
>Qsar went on to tell Bernard, Witherspoon and Lambert, who had played baseball together, about the potential acquisition. Each then purchased out-of-the-money call options on Del Taco stock, which was then trading on the Nasdaq with the symbol TACO, according to the SEC.

And then they got
caught, because in addition to being an effective way to make money insider
trading, this is also the easiest way to get caught insider trading.

Insider trading enforcement actions aren't that rare, so why is this one noteworthy?
Really the main reason this story caught my eye is because that I saw the headline
listed under sports news on Bloomberg.
Lots of white collar crime stories are just worth talking about because the people
and places involved conjure funny mental images.
Sharing sensitive corporate information during a
[drunk squash outing](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/insider-trading-case-options-former-goldman-sachs-barclays-squash-drunk-2023-6)
is a recent favorite of mine.
In this case we have "Qsar and Witherspoon allegedly made trades in Del Taco options from the locker room of a baseball training camp they were both attending."
Yeah, man, just whip out Robinhood after batting practice and illegally buy some TACO
options with the boys.
I also love when I can make news stories about me, and I'm a Washington Nationals
fan, so I enjoyed learning that Jordan Qsar was briefly part of the organization.
Go Nats!

About the actual story though, I want to mention some things these gentlemen
did right and some things they did wrong.
There are two parts to being caught insider trading: the "insider" part
and the "trading" part. If you want to get away with it
(you shouldn't, it's illegal, I extremely do not recommend insider trading, if
you do it talk to a lawyer but also don't do it)
you need to hide both. In this case they did a good job with the former but
not the latter.

The Jack in the Box employee who spilled the beans
on the merger appears not to have made any trades on the information,
and presumably there's no evidence that he intended Qsar to trade
on it or that he expected any sort of reward for sharing the info, or else
the DOJ would be going after him too.
Assuming that's the case, then Qsar did a good job identifying an opportunity
to (allegedly) insider trade where the path leading back to the
insider is decently weak.
If it doesn't look like the insider himself is planning to trade and you don't
have any incriminating electronic communication with him, then what are
the chances the authorities can make any connection? You played baseball with
the guy at Pepperdine like six years ago. Probably half of that team are
working in M&A now and most of them are regularly yoloing
fast food call options for fun, so there's nothing special about you.

Additionally:
>Despite knowing of a potential deal, the SEC said that Qsar and Witherspoon texted each other pretending that Del Taco was a great investment opportunity. They tried to come up with alternative explanations for their trades, the regulator said.
>In one example cited by the SEC, Witherspoon texted Qsar: “[c]heck out this stock guys Del taco, this chart is looking bullish to me. Might try to gamble on some options or something, I love to eat at del taco,” according to the SEC. 

This is really good. A lot of these cases involve defendants texting in extremely
stupid code about their insider tips and how much money they're making.
In this case, the plausible deniability is cheekier, which is fun, and possibly
more plausible.
"Look, your honor, you can clearly see that I'm just a degenerate gambler"
might be better than "your honor we were actually texting at length about our
pet chickens named Jack and Taco" or whatever someone less clever might have
come up with.

They did get caught, though, and it's mostly because they did absolutely
nothing to hide the trading.
Matt Levine's [second law of insider trading](https://lawsofinsidertrading.com/)
is "don't buy short-dated out-of-the-money call options on merger targets."
Basically every time a merger is announced the SEC looks to see if there
was any unusual activity in the options markets leading up to the
announcement date, and if they catch even a whiff of suspicion they'll
investigate and find you. 
Unfortunately for the defendants, this completely ruins everything I praised them 
for above.
It's like if Ocean's Eleven planned their casino heist and then changed their mind
and decided to rob a liquor store in front of police headquarters at noon instead.

### A Brief Explanation

If you're not familiar with some of these concepts, like what
short-dated out-of-the-money call options are and what they have to do with
insider trading, here's a primer.
Feel free to skip it if you know what I'm talking about and
you just want to read my further takeaways from this story.
None of this should be considered legal advice and it might also be factually wrong!
I am simplifying things, don't believe what you read on the internet, etc.

If you have so-called "material nonpublic information" (MNPI) about a publicly
traded company (such as Jack in the Box Inc., which trades under the ticker JACK,
or Del Taco Restaurants Inc., which formerly traded as TACO), it is illegal for you
to trade that company's stock. The "material" part effectively means that it's
information that could be reasonably expected to affect the price were it to
become public.
When a company is acquired, the acquiring company typically buys
all of the outstanding shares of the target company for some price
greater than their current price. So, when a merger is announced, the price
of the target's stock usually jumps pretty quickly up to the price that
the acquirer has publicly announced they intend to pay for each share.
This means that information about a merger before it becomes public is
*extremely* material to the target stock's price.

So, let's say you hear that
[JACK is proposing to acquire TACO at a price of $12.51 per share.](https://investors.jackinthebox.com/news/news-details/2021/Jack-in-the-Box-to-Acquire-Del-Taco-Combining-Two-Challenger-Brands-to-Create-Substantial-Opportunities-for-Growth-and-Increased-Profitability/default.aspx)
First of all you'd say that $12.51 is a mighty steep price for a single
taco and tell Jack that home cooking is a little easier on the budget.
Bad jokes aside, if you were hell-bent on making money off of your MNPI
(again, illegal, don't do it) you might look at the current price of TACO,
see that it's been trading around $9, and realize that you can just buy as
many shares as you can to lock in a surefire 40% return.
You probably expect the announcement to come out
within a few months, if not sooner, so it's a pretty quick profit too.

Another key part of stories like this is that the alleged insider traders purchased
"out-of-the-money call options."
A call option is a contract that allows the buyer to purchase 100 shares
of a certain stock for a pre-determined price before some pre-determined date in
the future. The relevant terms here are "expiry" and "strike price."
If you purchase a call option on TACO expiring on December 17, 2021, with
a strike price of $12 (you can say "struck at 12"), that means that on
or before December 17 you can buy TACO
from the person on the other side of the contract for $12 per share, no
matter what the current market price is. If it's trading at $12.51, we would say
the option is "in the money," since the price of TACO is higher than the strike
price. You can lock in 51 cents of profit per share, for $51 total.
If TACO isn't trading above $12, the option is said to be "out of the money."
Crucially, if the option expires out of the money, you don't have to do anything;
you've spent whatever you paid for the option in the first place, but you have no
obligation to overpay for TACO.

So how much would you expect to pay for this option? If an
option is in the money, then the price should be roughly equal to the amount
by which it is in the money: a call struck at $12 when TACO
is trading at $15 ought to be worth at least $3 per share, so you should
have to pay at least $300 to buy this option. (In fact the quoting convention
is to divide that by 100, so the price would look something like 3.00 in this case).
If an option is out of the money, then the price roughly reflects the seller's
expectation that they might have to sell you some TACO at a loss if it goes
up past the strike price (if they think there's a 10% chance they have to eat
a 50 cent loss, they will want to quote you at least 0.05).
Notice how cheap 0.05 is: If the market doesn't expect the option to ever be in
the money, but you know for sure it will be, you can spend $5 to make $51.
Much better than 40%.
I'm far from an expert on options pricing, and I don't know where to find
comprehensive data from the market for TACO options in October--December of 2021.
But from looking at the price history of the stock
(it traded between $7.50 and $9.30 in the months leading up to the December 6
merger announcement and its price rarely moved more than a few percent per day)
and the current options prices for
[various similar fast food stocks](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RRGB/options),
I think 0.05 for December calls with a $12 strike is very roughly the right ballpark.
There may or may not have been $12 calls available at the time; maybe the highest
strike available was $10 or something, in which case you'd stand to make $2.51 per
share; you'd expect these to be more expensive than a $12 call but they were
probably still something like 0.25.
Either way a roughly 10x return is a reasonable order of magnitude.

The point of all this is that, if you know what you're doing and your MNPI
is solid, it is extremely straightforward to make a lot of money by buying
out-of-the-money call options on merger targets. It's can be as good as knowing
exactly what number a roulette wheel will spin next (although nowhere near as good
as knowing exactly what the Mega Millions numbers will be).
It's so straightforward, of course, that the SEC knows to look for it and
punishes it eagerly, which is why people don't try it.
Saying "it's easy to make money by insider trading on mergers"
is like saying "it's easy to save money by shoplifting."
