summary: In 2023 I started a quest to watch at least one new movie every week. These are ten of the movies I loved the most.
---

At the beginning of this year, I made three main resolutions for 2023: quit
Twitter, read one new book every month, and watch one new movie every week.
Results varied. I dutifully deleted the Twitter app from my phone on January
1st and saw immediate benefits in productivity and mood---for a few weeks
until other apps filled the vacuum.
Reading one book each month proved a little challenging. I was consistent for the
first few months, then fell behind, then tried to catch up, and then realized
it was starting to feel like a chore, so I gave myself permission to lapse.
I ended up starting ten books and finishing seven over the course of the year,
and I'm going into 2024 with a sizeable stack of unreads that I will
_non-committally_ work my way through without putting _any_ pressure on myself.
On the other hand, my resolution to watch one movie per week went way better
than I expected. 

I ended up watching 57 movies this year that I hadn't seen before. Some were
new releases I caught in theaters, others were old things I felt I'd missed
out on and needed to see. They're not all classics, or even that good, but
I enjoyed most of them. I've put together a list of the top ten that I watched
this year, in no particular order. The definition of this list is loose.
I'm not claiming that these are definitely better films than the other 47; it's
more like these are the ten that I either loved the most or felt deserved some
recognition. Anyway, here's the list. Beware spoilers.

## _The Banshees of Inisherin_ (2022)
I started the year by catching up on a few of the nominees for Best
Picture, and
[_The Banshees of Inisherin_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11813216/)
was my favorite of those. It's the exact sort of movie I tend to enjoy: 
the characters are interesting, the plot is (on some level) meaningless,
and the acting and atmosphere are executed perfectly. 
Director Martin McDonagh's particular brand of dark comedy works really well
for me here.  One has to be careful to avoid looking performatively edgy by
saying "I liked this movie for the shock factor," so I'll try to
sidestep that by saying I liked this movie because of *how ridiculous* the
shock factor is. This movie tells you that Brendan Gleeson is planning to cut
off his own finger, and then you say "that would be kind of insane, don't you
think," and it sort of agrees, "yeah, that would be dumb." And then Brendan
Gleeson cuts off his finger, and you look at the movie in disgust, and
the movie looks right back at you and says "what else were you expecting?"

## _Nope_ (2022)
I don't know how much I have to say about
[Nope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/)
other than that it's really, really good.
I'm not a horror movie scholar by any stretch, but I think anyone who is
avoiding this film on account of it being tagged with the word "Horror" on
IMDb is missing out on something great. While it has lots in common with
horror movies, it seems much more at its core like a sci-fi mystery presented
in the style of horror. It almost feels as though someone took a script that
could have been an all-time great episode of _Doctor Who_ and adapted it for the
big screen (I promise I mean that as a compliment).

## _2 Fast 2 Furious_ (2003)
One of the highlights of this year for me was watching every
feature-length movie in the _Fast & Furious_ franchise in time to see
_Fast X_ when it came out. There is a lot to be said about this series,
and I may even decide to write more about it someday. Right now I want to point
out that a lot has changed over the last two decades of this franchise's
complicated history, and I think the public consciousness has forgotten that the
first few of these movies _absolutely rock_, completely unironically. People
will disagree on where the series took its turn---some might say the decline
began as early as _The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift_, before the series
has been reduced to typical big-budget action junk food, but where it starts
becoming hard to take anything seriously.

[_2 Fast 2 Furious_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322259/),
however, deserves so much more love.
The first entry in the franchise should also get some credit for being great,
but the sequel is, for me, the peack of the series. It copies the formula from
the original and keeps Paul Walker, but sets aside Vin Diesel and benefits
greatly from a change of scenery. Abandoning LA for an opportunity to indulge in
the beachfront lifestyle and high-octane nightlife of Miami---[hmm, I wonder if
any other franchises could pull that off?](https://www.rockstargames.com/VI)
This movie introduces Tyrese and Ludacris to the cast, both of whom become
fixtures in the later films and whose characters I claim are the only
consistently enjoyable elements of the series. Devon Aoki and Eva Mendes also
deserve a shout-out for being just as fun to watch despite not ending up as core
members of Dom's Family.
The rest of the series sort of shrugs at the viewer and says,
"yeah, of course these movies are tedious and bad, they're formulaic
action movies, what did you expect?"
But at the end of the day, _2 Fast_ makes a strong case that a movie which is
shallow and formulaic _can be really fun!_ 

## _Kill Bill: Vol. 1_ (2003)
Somehow, before this year, I had seen _Kill Bill: Vol. 2_ but never
[_Kill Bill: Vol. 1_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/).
I had a whole afternoon to myself alone in my parents' house with a nice
big TV, so I decided, what the heck, I'll watch them both back-to-back.
Best idea I had all year. In contrast with _2 Fast_, _Kill Bill_ is
a tropey action movie while also being thought-provoking and while Uma Thurman
gives one of the best performances I think I'll ever see, period.
(And, of course, the tropiness is due to deliberate homage to kung-fu movies,
so no complaints from me.)
The depths of _Kill Bill_ have been explored by much more qualified
people than myself, so I won't try to give my own interpretation here.
My point is just that watching these movies, especially as a double-feature,
was a throughly rewarding experience---not _just_ "fun" or "cool set pieces"
or "great acting" or "dramatic" but all of those things at once.

## _The French Dispatch_ (2021)
Wes Anderson's _Fantastic Mr. Fox_ is one of my favorite movies ever;
I also liked _Isle of Dogs_ and _Moonrise Kingdom_ but until this year I
hadn't seen most of his other films. I decided to fix that, first by
watching _The Grand Budapest Hotel_. I thought it was a good movie, but
I didn't love it as much as I thought I would. I thought that maybe I'd
outgrown the Wes Anderson quirky aesthetic thing, or that it works better in the
stop-motion style and doesn't come across as well in live action.
[_The French Dispatch_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8847712/)
completely changed my mind. The eccentric Wes Anderson thing worked for me, and
I liked the anthology format a lot.
My favorite story was _The Concrete Masterpiece_, with
Benicio del Toro, L&eacute;a Seydoux, Adrien Brody, and Tilda Swinton.
The movie is also wonderfully short.
I really appreciate a story that can get you in and out of the door without
dilly-dallying and still give you time to find it meaningful;
_The French Dispatch_ manages to tell _three_ great stories in a row and keep
its overall runtime at 108 minutes.

## _When Harry Met Sally..._ (1989)
It felt culturally important to me, a young New York transplant, that I watch
this someday. I've seen and enjoyed a handful of the big rom-coms everyone's
heard of, and I think I figured
[_When Harry Met Sally..._](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/)
was just about as good as any of them. I certainly wasn't expecting it to
completely blow the rest of them out of the water. I think some
rom-com-heads would call this a hot take, probably because they think it's
overrated, but I can't stress enough how much more I liked it _as a film_
than so many other romantic comedies I like. I also maybe have some hot
takes about the standards to which we hold rom-coms in terms of depicting
realistic relationships, which I'll save for another time.
Anyway, this movie tells a really funny and cute love story that's stuck
with me ever since I saw it.

## _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ (2018)
I knew I'd want to see _Across the Spider-Verse_ in theaters when it came out
this year, so I made sure to finally see
[_Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/)
beforehand. I've definitely caught the superhero fatigue that's been going
around lately, but _Spider-Verse_ is such a refreshing take on the genre that
it doesn't matter that I'm bored of it. 
I'm really late to the party on commenting on the visual style of this film,
but, _damn_. _Into the Spider-Verse_ is an insanely cool movie to watch
and feels exactly how you'd want a comic book movie to feel.
The sequel was also spectacular and probably one of the best things I've seen in
a theater in a while.

## _Uncut Gems_ (2019)
At this point you might be reading this and thinking I've transmogrified
into a tedious film bro with posters of _Kill Bill_ and
[_Uncut Gems_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5727208/)
on my bedroom wall.  No posters yet, but the jury's still out on whether I've
become douchier this year.
Anyway, I liked _Uncut Gems_, sue me. The reason it's on this list is because
of how impressive I found its ability to cultivate tension throughout the
_entire_ story.
This movie stressed me out so much that I had to sort of watch it in my
peripheral vision while reminding myself it's not real.  It's not just the
driving conflict of the movie that's so anxiety-inducing. The movie goes out of
its way to deny the viewer even momentary comfort by making every scene
cringeworthy, such as when Adam Sandler's character has to shimmy past a row of
parents at his daughter's school play, or when he gets in a fight with The Weeknd
in the middle of a nightclub. And I won't spoil the ending here, but let's just
say that I have a deep appreciation for that kind of end to a story.

## _Face/Off_ (1997)
