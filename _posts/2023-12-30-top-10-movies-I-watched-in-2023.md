summary: In 2023 I embarked on a quest to watch at least one new movie every week. These ten movies stood out to me the most so I'm going to talk about them.
---

At the beginning of this year, I made three main resolutions for 2023: quit
Twitter, read one new book every month, and watch one new movie every week.
Results varied. I dutifully deleted the Twitter app from my phone on January
first and saw immediate benefits in productivity and mood---for a few weeks
until other apps filled the vacuum.
Reading one book each month proved more challenging. I was consistent for the
first few months, then fell behind, then tried to catch up, and then realized
it was starting to feel like a chore, so I gave myself permission to lapse.
I ended up starting ten books and finishing seven over the course of the year,
and I'm going into 2024 with a sizeable stack of unreads that I will
_non-committally_ work my way through without putting _any_ pressure on myself.
On the other hand, my resolution to watch one movie per week went way better
than I expected. 

I ended up watching 57 movies this year that I hadn't seen before. Some were
new releases I caught in theaters, others were old things I felt I'd missed
out on and needed to see. They're not all classics, or even that good, but
I enjoyed most of them. I've put together a list of the top ten that I watched
this year, in no particular order. The definition of this list is loose.
I'm not claiming that these are definitely better films than the other 47; it's
more like these are the ten that I either loved the most or felt deserved some
recognition. Anyway, here's the list. There may be spoilers!

## _The Banshees of Inisherin_ (2022)
I started off the year by catching up on a few of the nominees for Best
Picture, and
[_The Banshees of Inisherin_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11813216/)
was my favorite. It's the exact sort of movie I tend to enjoy: 
the characters are interesting, the plot is (on some level) meaningless,
and the acting and atmosphere are executed perfectly. 
Director Martin McDonagh's particular brand of dark comedy works really well
for me here.  One has to be careful to avoid looking performatively edgy by
saying "I liked this movie for the gore and shock factor," so I'll try to
sidestep that by saying I liked this movie because of *how ridiculous* the
shock factor is. This movie tells you that Brendan Gleeson is planning to cut
off his own finger, and then you say "that would be kind of insane, don't you
think," and it kind of agrees, "yeah, that would be dumb." And then Brendan
Gleeson cuts off his finger, and you look at the movie in disgust, and
the movie looks right back at you and says "what else were you expecting?"

## _Nope_ (2022)
I don't know how much I have to say about
[Nope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/)
other than that it's really, really good.
I'm not a horror movie scholar by any stretch, but I think anyone who is
avoiding this film on account of it being tagged with the word "Horror" on
IMDb is missing out on something great. While it has lots in common with
horror movies, it feels to me like a sci-fi mystery at its core presented
in the style of horror. It almost feels like someone took a premise that could
have been an all-time great episode of _Doctor Who_ and adapted it for the
big screen (I promise I mean that as a compliment).

## _2 Fast 2 Furious_ (2003)
One of the highlights of this year for me was watching every
feature-length movie in the _Fast & Furious_ franchise in time to see
_Fast X (2023)_ when it came out. There is a lot to be said about this series,
and I may even decide to write more about it someday. Right now I want to point
out that over the last two decades of this franchise's storied history, a lot
has changed, and I think the public consciousness has forgotten that the first
few of these movies _absolutely rock_, completely unironically. People will
disagree on where the series took its turn: I would guess a big point of
contention is _The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)_, before the series
has been reduced to typical big-budget action junk food,
but where it gets hard to take anything seriously.

[_2 Fast 2 Furious_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322259/)
is the entry that deserves _so much_ more love.
The first entry in the franchise should get credit for being a great movie too,
but the sequel is, for me, the peak of the series. It copies the formula from
the original, keeps Paul Walker, but sets aside Vin Diesel and benefits greatly
from a change of scenery. Abandoning LA for an opportunity to indulge in the
beachfront lifestyle and high-octane nightlife of Miami---
[hm, I wonder if any other franchises could pull that off?](https://www.rockstargames.com/VI)
This movie also introduces Tyrese and Ludacris to the cast, both of whom become
fixtures in the later movies and whose characters I claim are the only
consistently enjoyable elements of the series. Devon Aoki and Eva Mendes also
deserve a shout-out for being just as fun to watch despite not ending up as core
members of Dom's Family.
At the end of the day, _2 Fast_ strongly makes the case that a movie which is
shallow and formulaic _can be really fun!_
