# About Me

I'm a Mathematics and Computer Science major at Williams College,
in the class of 2021. I like programming in all of its forms,
but I particularly enjoy low-level systems programming,
and, on the other end of the spectrum, Haskell.
My main mathematical interests lie in algebra and 
more specifically algebraic number theory.

I also like video games and learning about how they work.
I recently worked on a research project that involved
digging into source code for old Dr. Mario games
and reverse-engineering some of the algorithms they employ.
Because of this, I now sometimes speedrun Dr. Mario,
in addition to some other games. My favorite
game to speedrun is Super Mario Odyssey.
